* About

This is another emacs config of mine, which is a totally rewritten version
based on top of [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][spacemacs]] and [[https://github.com/coldnew/coldnew-emacs][coldnew-emacs]] with [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate programming]]
in [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]], but it uses English to write this config instead.

Feel free to use it :).

** Install or testing this config

- First use git to download whole repo

  : git clone https://github.com/coldnew/coldnew-spacemacs.git

- Then use git submodule to download the spacemacs

  : git submodule init
  : git submodule update

- Before trying to start emacs, you need to bootstrap it with [[https://github.com/cask/cask][Cask]]

  : cask install

- Then use the =make= command to generate an init.el file

  : make init.el

- If you do not put this repo on =~/.emacs.d=, you need to use following
  command to start emacs

  : emacs -q -l ~/coldnew-spacemacs/init.el

** Packages need to install in system (Optional)

Some extra packages need to be installed in the system manually. These packages
are =optional= but can make this spacemacs config work much more nicely.

- Mac OSX

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    brew install the_silver_searcher \
         fasd \
         doxymacs \
         aspell --with-lang-en

    brew install mu --with-emacs --HEAD
  #+END_SRC


- Gentoo Linux

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    USE="emacs" emerge sys-apps/the_silver_searcher \
       app-shells/fasd \
       net-mail/mu \
       app-emacs/doxymacs \
       aspell
  #+END_SRC

* Initialization Emacs

There are some configurations I need to put at the beginning of the emacs config. These
configurations are derived from my original init.el file.

** load prefer newer

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; since emacs 24.4, new option `load-prefer-newer' has been
  ;; introduce, which make me never accidentally using outdated compiled files.
  (setq load-prefer-newer t)
#+END_SRC

** Change the user-emacs-directory

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; We set `user-emacs-directory' here so we can use command-line
  ;; switch different emacs configuration like following:
  ;;
  ;;    emacs -q -l ~/coldnew-spacemacs/init.el
  (setq user-emacs-directory
        (file-name-directory (or load-file-name (buffer-file-name))))
#+END_SRC

** Define user-cache-directory variable

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defconst user-cache-directory
    (file-name-as-directory (concat user-emacs-directory ".cache"))
    "My emacs storage area for persistent files.")
#+END_SRC

* Package Management with Cask and Pallet

[[https://github.com/rdallasgray/pallet][Pallet]] is a wonderful little tool built on [[https://github.com/cask/cask][Cask]], a dependency
management tool for Emacs packages. Pallet adds automatic updating of
the =Caskfile= when packages are installed and deleted.

** Installing Cask

Just run this command in your terminal of choice:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
  $ curl -fsSkL https://raw.github.com/cask/cask/master/go | python
#+END_SRC

then add =~/.cask/bin= to your =PATH= so that you can use =cask=.

** Creating a Caskfile

For now, we just need a minimal =Cask= to get Pallet set up. Mine
looks like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (source gnu)
  (source melpa)

  (depends-on "evil")
  (depends-on "f")
  (depends-on "s")
  (depends-on "dash")
  (depends-on "pallet")
  (depends-on "req-package")
#+END_SRC

Then run the following command in your =.emacs.d= directory to set up
[[https://github.com/rdallasgray/pallet][Pallet]].

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
  cask install
#+END_SRC

** Initialize Cask

Finally, we add the following lines to our init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'cask "~/.cask/cask.el")
  (cask-initialize)
#+END_SRC

** Initialize Pallet

Since we already install pallet via cask, we just need to use the 
following code to initialize pallet.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'pallet)
  (pallet-mode t)
#+END_SRC

* Dependency Management with req-package

[[https://github.com/edvorg/req-package][req-package]] is a wrapper on top of [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]], a package dependency
management tool. The documentation for =use-package= is immensely
helpful for figuring out how to describe package dependencies and
settings. =req-package= adds the =:require= keyword which allows us to
define dependencies between related packages.

** Initialize req-package

With the preceding process complete, we just need to add the following
line to our init file to begin using =req-package=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'req-package)
#+END_SRC

** Start loading packages in right order

To start loading packages in right order, we need to added following
in the last of emacs config.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (req-package-finish)
#+END_SRC

You can take a look at [[*End%20of%20configuration][End of configuration]] section.

* Load Path

The variable =load-path= lists all the directories where Emacs should
look for Elisp files.

Though I use =Cask= as package management in my emacs, some local
packages like my own theme or others can't fetch by elpa need to add
to load-path, this will help emacs find them.

Following are my method to add directories to load-path ~recursively~,
this function also create directory to prevent directory not exist.

If you don't have any local elisp and all packages is mantain by cask
or elpa or spacemacs, you can skip following code.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Add directories to emacs's `load-path' recursively.
  ;; if path does not exist, create directory.
  (let* ((lisp-dir '("local-lisp/" "theme/")))
    (dolist (lisp-path lisp-dir)
      (when (not (file-exists-p lisp-path))
        (make-directory (concat user-emacs-directory lisp-path) t))
      (let* ((load-dir (concat user-emacs-directory lisp-path))
             (default-directory load-dir))
        (setq load-path
              (append
               (let ((load-path (copy-sequence load-path)))
                 (append
                  (copy-sequence (normal-top-level-add-to-load-path '(".")))
                  (normal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path)))
               load-path)))))
#+END_SRC
* Spacemacs

[[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][Spacemacs]] is an emacs starterkit focus on [[https://gitorious.org/evil/pages/Home][Evil]], which emulate vim
keymap on Emacs.

I make my emacs on top of spacemacs since I also use vim keymap.

In my config file, the original =~/.spacemacs= file has move to
=spacemacs.el= under user-emacs-directory folder, I also advice spacemacs funtion
to prevent orphan packages deleted by spacemacs.

After all spacemacs init done, switch back to =*scratch*= buffer.

** Load basic spacemacs configuration file

The original spacemacs will load =~/.spacemacs= as user configuration
file, I move this file to =~/.emacs.d/spacemacs.el=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Use `~/.emacs.d/spacemacs.el' instead of `~/.spacemacs'
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-filepath
                (concat user-emacs-directory "spacemacs.el"))

  ;; FIXME: why (dotspacemacs/location) not following dotspacemacs-filepath ?
  ;; it's BUG!!!!!!
  ;; This is fixed in spacemacs's commit `afde9f2', but not for stable-release yet.
  (let ((dotspacemacs/location "~/.spacemacs"))
    (if (not (file-exists-p dotspacemacs/location))
        (make-symbolic-link (concat user-emacs-directory "spacemacs.el") dotspacemacs/location)))

  (load (concat user-emacs-directory "spacemacs.el"))
#+END_SRC

** Overwrite spacemacs function to let it not remove my packages

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Make spacemacs not remove my orphan packages.
  (defadvice configuration-layer/delete-orphan-packages (around null-func activate)
    "Overwrite the spacemacs's `configuration-layer/delete-orphan-packages'
    to make it not remove any orphan packages.")

  (defadvice spacemacs/check-for-new-version (around null-func activate)
    "Overwrite the spacemacs's `spacemacs/check-for-new-version' to
    makt it useless since I use git submodule to bundle spacemacs with my emacs.")
#+END_SRC

** Load spacemacs

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Make a fake entry point for spacemacs, also modify the
  ;; `user-emacs-directory' temporary to mislead spacemacs real emacs
  ;; directory.
  (let* ((spacemacs-dir
          (directory-file-name (concat user-emacs-directory "spacemacs")))
         (spacemacs-init
          (concat (file-name-as-directory spacemacs-dir) "init.el"))
         (user-emacs-directory (file-name-directory spacemacs-init)))

    ;; Initial spacemacs, our emacs run on top of it
    (load spacemacs-init))

  ;; Disable global highlight by default (which is set by spacemacs.)
  (global-hl-line-mode -1)

  ;; After spacemacs loading finished, switch back to `*scratch*' buffer
  (switch-to-buffer "*scratch*")
#+END_SRC

* Basic setup

Most setup I want to use is done by [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][spacemacs]], but I still keep some
basic setup here, some are not set or just keep for backward compability.

** Startup emacs server

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Only start server mode if I'm not root
  (unless (string-equal "root" (getenv "USER"))
    (require 'server)
    (unless (server-running-p) (server-start)))
#+END_SRC

** Under Mac OSX use Command key as ALT

Under Mac OSX, I always bind =Caps lock= as Control key, and make the
=Command= key as =ALT= key like I done in Linux.

The =Option= key will be setup as =Super=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq mac-option-modifier 'super)
  (setq mac-command-modifier 'meta)
#+END_SRC

** Don't ask me when close emacs with process is running

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defadvice save-buffers-kill-emacs (around no-query-kill-emacs activate)
    "Prevent annoying \"Active processes exist\" query when you quit Emacs."
    (flet ((process-list ())) ad-do-it))
#+END_SRC

** Don't ask me when kill process buffer

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq kill-buffer-query-functions
        (remq 'process-kill-buffer-query-function
              kill-buffer-query-functions))
#+END_SRC

* Languages and Encodings

Since current Emacs default run on UTF-8, it's no need to setup the
encoding.

For language, though Traditional Chinese is my mothertone, I still
prefer use =en_US= to display time info.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)
  (setq system-time-locale "en_US" )
#+END_SRC

* Packages

Most of emacs packages do not need many configs or just provide
commands/functions to use, I put them here.

** exec-path-from-shell

[[https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell][exec-path-from-shell]] is A GNU Emacs library to ensure environment variables
inside Emacs look the same as in the user's shell.

Ever find that a command works in your shell, but not in Emacs?

This happens a lot on OS X, where an Emacs instance started from the GUI
inherits a default set of environment variables.

This library works solves this problem by copying important environment
variables from the user's shell: it works by asking your shell to print out the
variables of interest, then copying them into the Emacs environment.

I always use dark theme for coding, [[https://github.com/kuanyui/moe-theme.el][moe-theme]] is a good start point,
it's bright and has good default faces for most modes. It also has
dark and light versions, which is convenient.

However, I always want to customize everything on my own, so I rebuild
another emacs theme called =coldnew-theme-night= and
=coldnew-theme-day= which are based on [[https://github.com/kuanyui/moe-theme.el][moe-theme]], you can find them at

* Editors

Why emacs config has an editor section, doesn't means emacs is not an
editor ? Yes, Emacs is an OS :)

I put some editor/IDE relative functions and packages here.

orient yourself in the code, and tell which statements are at a given
depth.

    Take emacs-lisp-mode as example, if you wand to use <r to expand your snippet `require'

*** On-the-fly evaluation/substitution of emacs lisp code

[[https://github.com/Fuco1/litable][litable]] keeps a list of pure functions as a safeguard for unwanted
evaluations. A function must first be accepted into this list (using
M-x litable-accept-as-pure) before it can be evaluated on-the-fly. You
should take care of what function you accept as pure to avoid any
unfortunate accidents. Also, note that the pure functions list
persists across sessions.

*** Insert libraries in project more easily

[[https://github.com/AdamClements/latest-clojure-libraries][latest-clojure-libraries]] helps to looks up the latest version of clojure
libraries on clojars/maven and automatically populates the buffer with the
appropriate dependency vector. Optionally uses pomegranate to load the
dependency directly into your running nrepl.

To use this plugin, you need to edit your =~/.lein/profiles.clj= :plugins vector
to include =[lein-ancient "0.5.1"]= and optionally add
=[com.cemerick/pomegranate "0.2.0"]= to your :dependencies vector if you want
the feature which automatically adds the library to your classpath without
restarting the repl.

After all step done, use =M-x latest-clojure-libraries-insert-dependency= to
insert latest clojure libraries to your project.

** Make offlineimap get password from emacs

My email password is saved in =~/.authinfo.gpg=, which is encrypted by
gnupg, since I prefer make =prompt for password dialog= show on my
emacs, I let offlineimap get the emacs password via my emacs.

To achive this, you need add following conifg in =~/.offlineimaprc=

: pythonfile = ~/.offlineimap.py

Then create a file named =~/.offlineimap.py= with following code

#+begin_src python :tangle no
  #!/usr/bin/env python

  import subprocess

  def get_output(cmd):
      # Bunch of boilerplate to catch the output of a command:
      pipe = subprocess.Popen(cmd, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)
      (output, errout) = pipe.communicate()
      assert pipe.returncode == 0 and not errout
      return output

  def get_password_emacs(host, port):
      cmd = "emacsclient --eval '(offlineimap-get-password \"%s\" \"%s\")'" % (host,port)
      return get_output(cmd).strip().lstrip('"').rstrip('"')
#+end_src

From =~/offlineimap.py=, we can see I use emacsclient call eslip
function to get the password, so you also need to add
=offlineimap-get-password= function in your ~/.emacs

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun offlineimap-get-password (host port)
    (require 'netrc)
    (let* ((netrc (netrc-parse (expand-file-name "~/.authinfo.gpg")))
           (hostentry (netrc-machine netrc host port port)))
      (when hostentry (netrc-get hostentry "password"))))
#+end_src

After all is done, add following line in =~/.offlineimaprc= and we can get password by emacs.

: remotepasseval = get_password_emacs("imap.gmail.com")

** Setup my email acount list

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq coldnew/mu4e-account-alist

           (mu4e-trash-folder "/Gmail/Trash")
           (user-mail-address "coldnew.tw@gmail.com")
           (smtpmail-smtp-server "smtp.gmail.com")
           (smtpmail-smtp-service 587)
           (smtpmail-smtp-user "coldnew.tw@gmail.com")
